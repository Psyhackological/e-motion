## :file_folder: Code Structure

### [`preprocess`](src/twitter_roberta.py#L14)
The `preprocess` function is designed to prepare input text for sentiment analysis by sanitizing user mentions and URLs. This preprocessing step ensures that the sentiment analysis focuses on the text's content rather than extraneous elements like user handles or links.

- **Arguments**:
  - `text (str)`: The text to be preprocessed.
- **Returns**:
  - `str`: The sanitized text, with user mentions replaced with "@user" and URLs with "http".

### [`predict_sentiment`](src/twitter_roberta.py#L24)
The `predict_sentiment` function leverages the RoBERTa model for sentiment analysis. It first preprocesses the input text, then uses the tokenizer and model to predict sentiment scores, which are converted to probabilities using the softmax function.

- **Arguments**:
  - `text (str)`: The text for sentiment analysis.
- **Returns**:
  - `dict`: A dictionary mapping sentiment labels to their corresponding scores.

### How Gradio Works

Gradio is used to create an interactive web interface for the sentiment analysis application. It allows users to input text and receive sentiment analysis results in a user-friendly format.

- **Interface Setup**:
  - The interface is defined within a `gr.Blocks` context, allowing for a customizable layout with components like text boxes, buttons, and labels.
- **Input and Output Components**:
  - Users input text into a textbox, and the sentiment analysis results are displayed in a label.
- **Event Handling**:
  - The `predict_sentiment` function is linked to a button click, triggering sentiment analysis upon user interaction.
- **Theming**:
  - A custom theme is applied to the interface for aesthetic enhancement.
- **Additional Features**:
  - The interface includes an image banner, clear button, markdown text for instructions, and predefined example inputs for easy testing.
- **Launching the Interface**:
  - The interface is launched and made accessible in a web browser using `demo.launch(inbrowser=True)`.

## :brain: RoBERTa model

e-motion uses the `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest` model, renowned for its performance in sentiment analysis tasks. Here some more information about base model - `RoBERTa`:

RoBERTa is like a super smart language program made by Meta in 2020. It's way better than its older version, `BERT` made by Google in 2018, because it learned from a much bigger collection of information.

Here's what makes RoBERTa special:

- **Big Learning Data:** RoBERTa learned from a really, really huge amount of data, much more than BERT. This helps RoBERTa **understand words and sentences better for tricky language tasks**.
- **Smart Word Guessing:** RoBERTa guesses words in a different way than BERT. **It tries to figure out words that are hidden in a sentence**. This helps it understand how words relate to each other.
- **Learning from Different Examples:** RoBERTa **learns from lots of different examples by changing words or translating sentences**. This makes it really good at handling different types of language.

RoBERTa shows off its skills in many language jobs:

- **Feeling Detector:** RoBERTa is great at figuring out if a piece of writing is **happy**, **sad**, or just **neutral**. It's better at this than BERT.
- **Question Answerer:** RoBERTa can quickly answer questions about a piece of writing. It's **faster**and **smarter** at understanding information compared to BERT.
- **Logic Expert:** RoBERTa can tell if one sentence **logically connects to another**. It's better at this logical stuff than BERT.
- **Short and Sweet Summarizer:** RoBERTa can make **short and accurate summaries of long pieces of writing**. It's better at picking out the important parts compared to BERT.
- **Language Translator:** RoBERTa can **smoothly** change words from one language to another, making translations sound **more natural**. It's better at this than BERT.

What data has been used to train RoBERTa? Here are the datasets that we found:

- **BOOK CORPUS and English Wikipedia dataset**: This data also used for training BERT architecture, this data contains **16GB** of text.
- **CC-NEWS**: This data contains 63 million English news articles crawled between September 2016 and February 2019. The size of this dataset is **76 GB** after filtering.
- **OPENWEBTEXT**: This dataset contains web content extracted from the URLs shared on Reddit with at least 3 upvotes. The size of this dataset is **38 GB**.
- **STORIES**: This dataset contains a subset of Common Crawl data filtered to match the story-like style of Winograd NLP task. This dataset contains **31 GB** of text.

Overall, we can see that it was trained with **161 GB of data**. Huuuuge amount!

The tool we're using makes RoBERTa even better by giving it special training on Twitter. This helps RoBERTa:

- **Get Twitter Language Better:** The tool has learned a lot from Twitter, including **slang**, **emojis**, and how people talk casually. This means RoBERTa can understand and respond to Twitter-style language more easily.
- **Figure Out Feelings in Tweets:** RoBERTa is fine-tuned to **know the emotions** in Tweets, like if they're **happy**, **sad**, or **angry**. This makes it good for tasks like understanding how people feel and what they think.
- **Find Important Stuff in Tweets:** RoBERTa can do **more than just understand feelings**. It can also find trends, topics people are talking about, and the overall mood of a conversation in Tweets.
- **Handle Lots of Tweets Fast:** The tool is **built to quickly deal with a bunch of Tweets**. This makes it great for checking what's happening on Twitter in real-time.

**RoBERTa is like a language superhero and we are excited about what else RoBERTa can do in the future – that’s why we gave it a shot!**
